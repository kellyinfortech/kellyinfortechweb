## Inspiration
My journey towards working on this portfolio project is not merely rooted in a passing interest, but rather, it is deeply intertwined with a significant transition in my life. When my team expressed their enthusiasm for creating a project centered around personal portfolios, I found myself drawn to the challenge, despite not having a personal affinity for the subject matter.

Transitioning from a career as a telecommunication and IT to pursuing software engineering was a monumental shift for me. After the factory closure left me unemployed for two years, I made the courageous decision to relocate across the country with my wife and two daughters, embarking on a journey of reinvention and self-discovery

As I immersed myself in the rigorous curriculum at Holberton School through ALX Kenya, I found solace and purpose in the world of software development. The portfolio project presented an opportunity for me to showcase not only my technical skills but also my resilience and determination in navigating life's transitions.

As I reflect on this project, I am reminded of the unwavering support of my family, the camaraderie of my peers, and the transformative power of perseverance. Through my portfolio project, I hope to not only demonstrate my technical proficiency but also share a glimpse of the personal journey that has shaped my identity as a software engineer.
